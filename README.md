####Project Title: Analysis on Titanic Dataset
Project Data Source: @Kaggle.com
Tools Used: Excel, Power Query, DAX, and Power BI for Visualization
Analyzed by: @Adeyemi Adenuga

🔍 Project Objectives:
1️⃣ To analyze passenger demographics, ticket classes, and survival trends on the Titanic.
2️⃣ To uncover key insights using data analysis and visualization techniques.
3️⃣ To make recommendations for enhancing data-driven decision-making processes.

📊 Analysis Highlights:
✔️ Total Passengers: 891 | Total Fare Revenue: $29K | Average Age: 29
✔️ Overall Survival Rate: 38.38%
✔️ Children Survival Rate (Age < 12): 96.5% – the highest among all age groups!
✔️ Passenger Segments by Age Group:
Adults: 60.04%
Young Adults: 24.35%
Children: 15.6%
✔️ Passenger Distribution by Embarkation Ports:
Southampton: 645 passengers
Cherbourg: 169 passengers
Queenstown: 77 passengers
✔️ Fare Revenue Insights:
1st Class: $8.8K – highest revenue from Adults
2nd Class: $6.4K
3rd Class: $2.9K
📌 Key Insights:
✅ Children (Age < 12) had the highest survival rate (96.5%), showing prioritization during evacuation.
✅ Passengers from Southampton made up the majority (72.4%) of travelers.
✅ Revenue contributions were highest from 1st Class passengers, highlighting socioeconomic disparities in travel.
✅ Overall survival rates were low (38.38%), with marked differences based on gender, age, and class.

💡 Recommendations:
1. There is need to educate passengers on safety measures and evacuation protocols for future evacuation priorities for vulnerable groups (such as children and young adults).
2. Organizations should create easily accessible lifeboat routes for passengers from all ticket classes, particularly 3rd Class, where survival rates were lower.
3. Organizations could use insights from fare revenue patterns to optimize services for different passenger classes.
4. Utilize historical passenger data to predict potential risks or incidents during voyages
